# TensorFlow.js Object Detection with React + Vite

This project is an example of utilizing TensorFlow.js within a React application built with Vite. It leverages the COCO-SSD (Common Objects in Context - Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model for object detection tasks

## Introduction

TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and on Node.js. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Vite is a fast build tool that significantly speeds up the development process.

## Feature

- Integrates TensorFlow.js seamlessly with React and Vite.
- Utilizes the COCO-SSD model for real-time object detection tasks.
- Provides an intuitive and interactive user interface for object detection.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- After completing the clone, go to the directory using `cd realtime-object-detection `.
- Install dependencies using `npm install`.
- Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
- Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL `http://localhost:5173/`.

the commant is here :
```sh
cd realtime-object-detection
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Usage

Once the app is running, you can perform object detection tasks by using your device's camera. Click Scan Now to start real-time object detection.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
